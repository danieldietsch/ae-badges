# About the sources

The badges were drawn with [Inkscape 0.92.4](https://inkscape.org/).
The SVG file in this directory is the original Inkscape-svg (svg with Inkscape's metadata).
The font is [Tex Gyre Adventor](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/adventor).
The colors are from the color palette of [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/brand).

The PDFs generated by Inkscape (and many other tools) may lead to the following warning in pdfTeX:

```text
PDF inclusion: multiple pdfs with page group included in a single page
```

For more information see [this Stack Overflow discussion](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/76273/99001).
You can either

- ignore the warning,
- or suppress the warning by adding `\pdfsuppresswarningpagegroup=1` to the very top of your main tex file,
- or convert PDFs generated by Inkscape with the ghostscript command `gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -o new.pdf old.pdf`.
