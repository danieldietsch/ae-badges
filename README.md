**Badges for the artifact evaluation of the VMCAI conference.**
You may put these on your papers if you were awarded by the VMCAI committee.
For more information see [Call for Artifacts][1].

To put a badge on a paper written in LaTeX embed the PDF files as graphics:

```tex
% compile with pdflatex file.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
    \includegraphics{1-available}
    \includegraphics{2-functional}
    \includegraphics{3-reusable}
\end{document}
```
